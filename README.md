# Welcome!
This repository contains the programs for computing spectral and nuclear norms of $3^{\text{rd}}$-order tensors.

# How to use?
Run the files *spectral_norm_compute.m* and *nuclear_norm_compute.m*.

# Dependencies
The following package is required for computing nuclear norms:
- CVX (downloadable from [here](https://cvxr.com/cvx/download/)).

# P.S.
Higher-order tensors may be supported in the future, subject to user needs.
